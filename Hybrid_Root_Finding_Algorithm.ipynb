    "Finding the root of a function is a fundamental aspect of mathematics and physics. It is essential for solving equations appearing in various areas such as algebra, numerical analysis, and calculus. Using a coded algorithm to find roots can be extremely useful as it is not only highly efficient, but accurate and a versatile tool that performs a task that would usually be time consuming in less than a second. There are many algorithms which make use of known mathematical formulas and techniques to locate the roots of a function. However, these usually come with drawbacks, as certain algorithms struggle with specific types of functions. For example, the Newton\\-Raphson method, while highly efficient, may not converge to a root if the derivative is too small, or if the initial guess is not close enough to the root. The idea of a 'hybrid' function certainly is not new, as seen by the report made by the computer science department at Missouri University of Science and Technology \\[[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/7/11/1118)\\], who combined the Bisection and Regula\\-Falsi methods into a function. In this report, I will be using three root finding algorithms and leveraging their strengths to create a hybrid root finding algorithm. This algorithm aims to be able to provide the roots of any function you give it.\n",

    "The three algorithms I will be using are the Newton\\-Raphson method, the Regula\\-Falsi method and the Bisection method. My method will be to test each algorithm with different types of functions to see where they fail and excel, and then use this information to create a hybrid function. This report will also show how I tested the hybrid function and improved it along the way, as well as using it to solve a real physics problem.  \n",

    "The hybrid algorithm is a combination of all three methods, giving us a single root finding algorithm where if one method fails, there are two other methods to make up for it. The way I will do this is that I will be using a tolerance close to zero. This is an idea I got from an article about numerical methods for root finding \\[[2](https://www.bragitoff.com/2023/01/numerical-methods-for-root-finding-with-python-code/)\\], which adds a tolerance into each individual function. If a method fails to produce a root within the tolerance, then it will move on to the next algorithm. Apart from that, the hybrid function in this state has not been modified much beyond just putting all three methods into a single function. This is currently just a simple combination of the methods which will be improved on later on, I am showing the steps in my development of the algorithm.\n",

    "This is good. The hybrid algorithm is now not just a simple combination of three methods, it is utilising the Regula\\-Falsi method to the extent that it is outperforming the individual, and putting it to better use by combining it with the Newton\\-Raphson method. To explain, the Regula\\-Falsi method \\(in the hybrid function\\) now works by switching to the Newton\\-Raphson method after 5 iterations. It is worth noting that this is only done when the derivative is given/calculated.\n",

    "The table shows that the hybrid function works just as well as the Newton-Raphson method when x0 is provided. Interestingly, for function f1, the polynomial with multiple roots, the Regula-Falsi outperforms the hybrid algorithm. This displays the trade off of using the hybrid algorithm, having an algorithm able to solve most, if not all functions will require a slight loss of efficiency in certain cases.\n",

Note that this will take a while to finish running as it is timing and storing all the data."

    "The hybrid root-finding algorithm that was developed in this report demonstrates many notable strengths, it has shown to be very useful and an improvement over the individual algorithms. It has many features which make it less time consuming, such as the fact that it can calculate the derivative for you. Most notably, the combination of the Regula-Falsi and Newton-raphson methods, which allows for the Newton-Raphson method to be used without having to provide an initial guess, or even a derivative. It has demonstrated really impressive results able to converge quickly even for difficult functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however several areas in which it is lacking. Most notably,  the fact that it does not support equations with several variables, as seen when solving Kepler's equation, where the lambda function was needed. Furthermore, the need to provide parameters is also a drawback, although the current algorithm can still run without an initial guess or derivative, I believe if the hybrid algorithm could calculate bounds on its own, it would be even better, and far more efficient for the user. I also believe a more accurate method for finding the derivative is possible."

    "My aim in this report was to create a hybrid algorithm that could leverage the strengths of three well-known root-finding algorithms and create a hybrid function that could solve most, if not any, equation. From my testing and results, I believe I have succeeded in creating a useful algorithm. It took some trial and error, but I was able to ensure that this hybrid function was not simply a combination of the three methods but a unique algorithm that improves upon the individual methods themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results relative to the individual methods were impressive. Although not a massive improvement, it was pleasing to see that the hybrid algorithm worked just as well or better in many cases. In terms of time taken, I believe the hybrid algorithm performs exceptionally—on par with the Newton-Raphson method—and is well worth the extra time it may take to provide the parameters based on the results, where the hybrid function out-performed the individual algorithms in several cases. The hybrid function was also able to solve Kepler's equation, which was done with very few issues, such as needing to use lambda so that I could pass E as an argument, which would otherwise cause an error since E was a parameter that needed to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the hybrid algorithm ahs demonstrated the ability to solve a variety of functions efficiently, and minimises the risks that come with using the individual algorithms separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe I have achieved my aims to a fairly high degree, but I also think the hybrid algorithm has significant potential and a need for further improvement. Supporting several variables to handle more complex functions easily is a much-needed enhancement, which I realized when solving Kepler's equation. This would be an excellent area for future projects to build upon, as well as automating parameter selection. This would allow hybrid algorithms to be incomparably better than any individual methods."
